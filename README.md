# OpenMath
Fine-tuning a Small Language Model (SLM) for Step-by-Step Math Reasoning

## Overview
**OpenMath** is an open-source project focused on fine-tuning a **small language model (SLM)** to solve **math word problems** with clear, step-by-step reasoning.  
The project uses **LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning** on popular math reasoning datasets and provides a benchmarking pipeline to compare performance against other open-source SLMs/LLMs.

This project is designed to be reproducible on **free Colab (T4) GPU**.

---

## What’s Included
- QLoRA fine-tuning code (4-bit)
- GSM8K subset training (example: 1k samples)
- GSM8K evaluation script (accuracy)
- Saved LoRA adapter weights

---

## Base Model
- **Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B**

---

## Dataset
- **GSM8K** (Grade School Math 8K)
- Training used: **1000 samples**
- Evaluation: GSM8K test split

---

## Results
### Training Setup (Current)
- Samples: 1000
- Epochs: 6
- Max length: 1024
- LoRA rank: 16
- Loss masking: trained mainly on the **solution portion** to improve reasoning

### Accuracy
- **GSM8K Accuracy (100-sample test subset): 41%**

> Note: The 41% score was measured on a **100-question subset** of the GSM8K test set for faster evaluation on Colab.

## Training Format & Loss Masking

### Training Prompt Template

The model was trained using a structured prompt format designed to encourage step-by-step reasoning:

```
### Instruction:
Solve the math problem step by step and give the final answer.

### Problem:
{question}

### Solution:
{answer}
```

`{question}` and `{answer}` represent dataset content placeholders.

---

### Loss Masking Strategy

To improve reasoning quality, loss was computed **only on the solution portion**:

- All tokens before `### Solution:` were masked with `-100`
- Only tokens belonging to the solution contributed to training loss

This encourages the model to focus on generating accurate reasoning steps rather than memorizing prompt structure.

---

### Special Tokens

- No additional special tokens were introduced
- Default tokenizer EOS token used as padding
- Template headers serve as separators

---

### Inference Format

During inference, the same prompt structure is used, but the solution portion is left empty:

```
### Instruction: ...
### Problem: {question}
### Solution:
```

The model then generates the reasoning and final answer.

## Repository Files
### LoRA Adapter Folder
This project provides the fine-tuned adapter weights:

- `adapter_model.safetensors` → LoRA weights
- `adapter_config.json` → LoRA configuration

> Note: This is **not a full model**.  
> You must load the **base model** and then attach the adapter.

---

## Inference Example

An example script (`inference.py`) is provided to demonstrate how to:
- Load the Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B base model
- Attach the fine-tuned LoRA adapter
- Run step-by-step math inference

Note: Running the script requires downloading the base model from Hugging Face.
